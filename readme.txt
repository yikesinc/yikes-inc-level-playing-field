A WordPress plugin that anonymizes job applications to fight bias in employment and promote true merit-based hiring.

== Description ==


Level Playing Field allows businesses and organizations to easily list jobs on a WordPress website and receive **anonymized** job applications with all identifiable applicant information hidden. Hiring managers can review applicants without seeing proven unconscious bias factors. Employers can message potential candidates and schedule interviews anonymously. After an interview is scheduled and confirmed, the applicantâ€™s information is revealed. This process gives people an opportunity to show their skills and strengths based on merit alone.

Level Playing Field is a tool that can help companies and nonprofits hire truly based on merit while providing more opportunities to people from diverse communities.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why anonymize job applications? =

Scientifically proven bias based on name, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age and other factors during the hiring process, has created a lack of diversity in various industries. This creates homogeneous teams and has a negative impact on productivity, corporate culture and profits. Hiding information that gives away an applicant's ethnicity, gender, age and other factors allows hiring managers to bring in applicants based purely on skills and qualifications.
