A WordPress plugin that anonymizes job applications to fight bias in employment and promote true merit-based hiring.

== Description ==


Level Playing Field allows businesses and organizations to easily list jobs on a WordPress website and receive **anonymized** job applications with all identifiable applicant information hidden. Hiring managers can review applicants without seeing proven unconscious bias factors. Employers can message potential candidates and schedule interviews anonymously. After an interview is scheduled and confirmed, the applicantâ€™s information is revealed. This process gives people an opportunity to show their skills and strengths based on merit alone.

Level Playing Field is a tool that can help companies and nonprofits hire truly based on merit while providing more opportunities to people from diverse communities.
